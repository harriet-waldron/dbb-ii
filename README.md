## Bean Brawl ##

This is the final project for Enspiral Dev Academy.
I was in a team of seven, and as the final part of this course, we had a week to complete a project of our choice. 
We decided to branch out into technology that hadn't been a part of the curriculum, and make a game using Phaser. The game is a 'Super Smash Bros' style fighting game that uses 'Paper, Scissors, Rock' style interactions to determine a winner. 

My part in this project, after participating in the initial Phaser reasearch and development, was to create the background art for the maps and start/end pages, tile maps, character sprites and animations. It was a bit strange that for the culmination of a coding course, I spent most of my time making art - but it was actually a clear way to see how much I had learnt about how to pick up unfamiliar technologies, approach entirely new tasks, and be adaptable in a fast paced learning environment. I had worked with Photoshop only once in the past and found it clunky and difficult, but after going through EDA and learning so much about how to learn and teach myself new things - I found PS suddenly enjoyable and easy to pick up.

My Agile roles in the group were Scrum Master and Vibes Lead, meaning I was tasked with monitoring each person's wellbeing in the group dynamic, and organising and leading the daily meetings. The text below shows the wellbeing plan and schedule that I wrote up.

This initial plan served the group really well throughout the whole week. We stuck to the stand up schedule, which allowed us all to stay updated on the project, manage individual workloads, and address issues quickly. The morning check ins were non tech related, so we could all know how everyone was doing and their capacity on any given day, and the retrospectives every day were a great time to work on any hitches in group dynamic and workflow, to be able to iterate on the way we were working.

I spent a lot of the week managing communication between others, checking in with progress and organising personal and group discussions. I learnt a lot in this process about how to manage others in a way that achieves interpersonal growth while still managing my own workload.

I recieved feedback from the group that I did well in these roles, that my work was integral to helping strong personalities coexist, and that I am a natural leader driven by compassion. 

I really enjoyed creating this project. At this stage, if you want to play it, it is controller only. The last deployed version also has a bug in the ball to ball interaction where player 1 wins by default. 

Deployed but slighly unfinished version:

A version refactored by one of my teaammates, Ben, that allows for keyboard play.

I am planning on also doing a refactored version with keyboard support.

Thank you for reading, happy playing!

- *Important to remember to both get outside and feed yourself every day. This is 
up to you, but breaks must be taken in some form, and you need to communicate with

periods.

##  Agreements // Expectations
-
-	-Communicate with the group. Everyone needs to know what is going on in order to 
work effectively as a team. This goes for stress levels, blocks, needs, long 
breaks etc. Scrums and check ins are scheduled times to speak to where you're at, 
otherwise use the slack group, speak with people individually or on an as needs 
basis. Use your judgement and keep others in the loop if your actions will affect 
them.
-	-Asking for help. Ask for help from team mates or teachers before the problem 
becomes too large, taxing or time consuming. This goes for both personal and 
coding issues.
-	-Face conflict and tension if it arises. Get a mediator if necessary but don't 
avoid conversations if they are asked for. It is fine to schedule a time rather 
than talk about it immediately.
-	-Do what you say you will, communicate if you can't do the thing so others aren't 
relying on work that never comes.
-	-Self responsibility, others will check in on you and fill whichever needs they can, 
but ultimately it is up to you to ensure you are looking after yourself, having breaks, 
practicing self empathy and managing your own workflow.
-
-	-MVP by Saturday latest
-	-Pair programming so everyone is at least learning if they don't have a task, general 
plan is to pair until the mvp is done then split into design / mechanical / stretch.
-
-	-Be on time, and show up for each other.
-	-Respect each other, remain kind, listen to each other, have fun learning new stuff.
-	-No judgement on anyone's needs or opinions. We are cultivating a safe space for 
everyone in this team.
-
-
## Needs && Wellbeing
-
-	-Later start time to help those that need to commute, also not everyone has time to 
complete code in the evenings because of the commute.
-	-Understand MVD as a concept (minimum viable day), if someone communicates they 
need to be having a MVD, don't expect them them to be at full or even half capacity.
-	-If a team member is having a bad day, it is perfectly okay for them to just do what 
they can, even if it means doing nothing and just being present for the day and the 
meetings.
-	-Human skills facilitators are always around for chats
-	-If someone is having a bad time but you need information out of them, let them know 
the importance and perhaps schedule a time to talk about it.
-
-	*Ricki-Jane has requested to be able to choose tasks that fit her best, and to be given 
given manageable work and autonomy over who she pairs with. If she is having space 
from coding, she would still like to be invited to join from time to time. Asking 
how she is / what she needs has an adverse affect when she doesn't feel capable 
of communicating, so with these understandings in mind, let her come to you and leave 
her be. 
-
-
-	-Have group lunches where we don't talk about code & can relax
-	-Basics, eat, don't just survive on coffee, get outside, move your body, rest your mind.
-

## Stress Profiles
-
-	-Morning check ins will help everyone to know if anyone is coming in to the day 
stressed or low capacity. The general agreement is that everyone manages themselves 
and remains self aware to know when stress is coming on. Communication will be 
important so everyone can look at this stress profile and know better how to manage it.
